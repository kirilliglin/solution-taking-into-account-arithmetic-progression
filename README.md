The text file consists of the characters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.
Determine the maximum number of consecutive characters in the attached file, among which the sequence of distances between the nearest
adjacent vowel letters forms an arithmetic progression.
For example, in the string BBDABCADEFBACDFAB, the substring BCADEFBACDFAB is suitable. The sequence of distances between the nearest neighboring vowel
letters in it is formed in increments of 1 and looks like this: 2, 3, 4.
Note. The distance refers to the difference in the indices.
To complete this task, you should write a program.
